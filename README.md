One of the primary objectives of this boot camp has been to become a web developer with a solid foundation in the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) tech stack. This week, you’ll step fully into that realm. You’ll combine all of your back-end knowledge—by implementing a Node.js and Express.js API with a MongoDB database—with your React front-end skills to create a single-page MERN social-media application.

You’ll use React Router to make the application behave more like a multi-page application, allowing users to bookmark URLs and use the browser’s forward and back buttons. You’ll also add GraphQL, an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs that lets you fetch only the data you want from the database when you need it and nothing more.

Finally, you’ll learn about an alternative authentication solution known as a JSON Web Token, or JWT. JWTs provide all the data you need in a single string, eliminate the need to save session IDs on the back end, don’t require as many server-side resources, and can be generated anywhere.
